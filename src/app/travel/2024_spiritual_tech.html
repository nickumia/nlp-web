<p>This page will be home to the updates relating to my road trip across America, coined as Spiritual
Tech.  It's important to understand the meaning behind the naming.  I'm defining <i>spiritual</i> as
anything that is not physical and my goal is to use technology to connect these spiritual elements to
create a better tomorrow.  I can't do it alone and I wouldn't want to if I could.  As much freedom as
there is in doing stuff by yourself, it's way more fun to do it with great company.<p>

<p>For now, check out the trailers for my trip to get a feel for what it'll be like.  If you like it,
please reach out and let's make some great stuff happen together!</p>

<p>The first map highlights the points of interest that will define the trip.  It ranges from state
capitals to amusement parks (specifically rollercoaster) to nature pockets (state parks, geographical
wonders and more) to major tourism spots to historical landmarks (specifically technological ones) to
spiritual centers and more.  The map is subject to updates (both before the start and during the trip).

<p>Feel free to add the map to your favorite map viewer.  It can be exported as KML/KMZ or directly
imported into google maps.  Sorry Apple users üò£ I don't have a direct solution for you. </p>

<p>The second map is a rough outline of the path that I'll take across America.  It seems like it is
pretty robust, but it is also subject to change as weather, cultural interactions or other events highlight
important considerations that affect maneuverability or safety.</p>
