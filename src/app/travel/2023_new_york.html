<p>This trip has been such a rollercoaster of emotions.
Starting from Florida and driving all the way up to New York, there were many side quests along the way.
Originally, I was going to try to do daily-ish updates.  I didn't anticipate the slump that I would be in though.
I've made this drive many times in the past and there's so much that I know about the drive.
For some reason, it felt off this time.
Maybe it was the circumstances that were different or maybe I was different..
I haven't been able to pin it down exactly.
What ended up happening was pretty representative of where I've been and my general trajectory into the future.</p>

<p>This is the first trip I've taken where I made the conscious effort to meet up with many friends I've made in my journeys so far.
I should mention though that the trip would not have been realized if it hadn't been for my super chill boss from my last job inviting me to his Christmas party.
I would love to share specifics, but seeing as how this is a public blog, it makes sense to protect sensitive information about people and things that should not be shared.</p>

<p>The journey started in South Florida, taking a detour in Orlando before heading up to Northern VA as the first stop.
After spending the day in Maryland with an awesome friend and her family,
I made it to New York for my two week stay with family and friends.
As much as New York will always be my birthplace and will hold a special place in me with innumerable memories,
I don't find joy in it.
If nothing else, this trip definitely solidified that aspect of my decisions so far.
It takes time to validate whether certain decisions are the right decisions.
There is seemingly so much time being wasted in my life;
yet, looking back now, a lot of things feel like part of me..
as if it makes sense without me understanding it.</p>

<p>Before I left, a close relation had shared some videos about Vedanta with me.
Without getting into the whole story, there's one idea that I'd like to share relating to happiness and my struggle with it over the years.
Essentially, the equation for happiness boils down to the number of fulfilled desired divided by the number of total desires (completed and incomplete).
100% happiness being 100% of a person's desires have fulfilled. </p>

<p>The given answer to the problem is to focus more on the denominator and not the numerator.
Reduce the number of total desires to the one core desire and then overcome that desire.
When this happens, a person will have naturally given up lots of things in life and wouldn't have a bunch of posessions to their name.
An alternate method to obtain a relatively high level of happiness is to keep running the rat race and complete as many desires to at least keep pace with the number of total desires.
In this case, a person accumulate lots of experience and things.</p>

<p>Concerning the topic of generational wealth, there's a predicament...
A person needs to have things in order to build a secure foundation for their children to thrive.
But how can they justify accumulating wealth through completion of desires if their ultimate goal is to reach true bliss.</p>
<p>I'd like to keep religion out of this discussion, just for the sake of simplicity.
Vedanta is a philosophy and we're not fully concerned with answering what lies in the future, or what it means.</p>

<p>Coming back to the point, one of my strongest desires has always been to find my true love and help build the next generation with her..
I met a girl this year... and she's been an absolute blessing in my life.
Without going into too much detail..</p>

<p>The reason I bring this up is because I missed her a lot on this trip.
And perhaps more than anything, dealing with this has been the hardest and led me to re-evaluate what this all means to me.</p>

<p>On other journeys between NY and FL, I was mostly caught up in the past.
Everything that's happened that put me in my current situation.
I was always thinking about the future through the lens of the past.
For the first time, in this way, I've been able to remember the past as the past, live and be aware in the present and be more accepting of having no real plan for the future.</p>

<p>Striving for better highlights the duality of happiness since <i>better</i> always has desires attached to it.
I was always planning a few steps into the future because, without a plan, I wander quite easily.
I like to think I've come up with a unique solution, which is I plan the goal, but not the steps to get there.
Spontaneity has been such a great tool for me to not feel stuck and to help me wander out of whatever lost paths I find.
I use it to inspire me to keep moving in the present, making truly precious memories;
all while continuing towards the larger goal I've set.</p>

<p>I've definitely gotten too abstract in this blog though and haven't mentioned enough about the actual trip haha..</p>

<p>On my drive up, I listened to some of 
Trevor Noah's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/122imavATqSE7eCyXIcqZL">'What Now?'</a> podcasts and,
my good friend, Jon Jim's <a href="https://1steppodcast.com/">'1 Step'</a> podcasts.
One of the biggest takeaways from Trevor Noah's podcasts was the explanation of the full <i>Blood is thicker than water</i> quote;
being that relationships that you choose to have (bonds/promises you make) are more important than the ones you don't choose (family).</p>

<p>Oddly related, I had met Jon and gotten to know him personally before I listened to most of his podcasts.
While listening to his podcasts, I witnessed a lot of beliefs and values that I had come to know through my personal relationship with him.
It made me wonder what was already part of him going into his interviews vs. what he had gained from sharing experience with the people he interviewed.
And I think that point just makes me want to do my road trip across America even more,
yearning to find out how people think, how that relates to me and how I can use that to build a better future.</p>

<p>Here's a cool random story, as I was driving through North Carolina, taking a detour to find some pizza,
I got onto NC-130, where I witnessed quite a bit of dry farms, probably winternized for the season.
There was a small holdup for some tree cutting.
The trees were tall too, no less than 100 ft.
The South is always weird to me..
The people aren't the friendliest and I can say with certainty that there's still a lot of racist vibes there.
However, seeing the tree fall was pretty cool and very unexpected.</p>

<p>Another unexpected phenomenon was seeing how calm the various water bodies where throughout the drive.
Coupled with the hills, quaint towns, cozy little corner shops and open space,
it all reminded me of the work trips I used to take to MD, my time living in NJ, my adventures in the suburban and rural parts of the North and just the difference between that and now.</p>

<p> ... skip ... </p>

<p>As I'll mention again, this blog was better suited to be a day-by-day take of everything that happened.
I write this on the night that I made it back to FL.
In the last 3 days alone, there is much that I'd like to share.
Written form would be way too ineffective a medium to convey everything that I'd like to.
I'm going to reassess how to make this effective, while keeping maintainability manageable.</p>

<p>As final thoughts for right now.. it felt so nice to make it back to FL.
I don't think I realized how much I feel emotions.
I knew I felt a lot, but it didn't seem unusual until recent experiences.
Empath doesn't sound like the right word for what/how I feel;
however, it's the only word that comes up when I look for a word describing,
"someone who feels a lot of emotions".
It could just be that Empaths have lots of subcategories and I've typically thought of a specific one when learning the word.</p>

<p>I found this series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2imXor63HtS4ewIKryBL4ZVeiaH8Ij4R">Vedanta Society of New York - Archives - Bhagavad Gita</a>
which are giving me lots of insight into some of my problems.
I hope to dive deeper into it in the next couple of days and incorporate it into my experiences.
Hearing that the goal described in the Bhagavad Gita is to obtain knowledge of the self,
by extension, reframing how I've been thinking about my finding-fulfillment predicament was powerful for me.</p>

<p>I was definitely hoping that I could get all of my feelings about NY out in this blog as a masterpiece of what NY means to me.
But that was a serious overexpectation and the blog kind of fell apart from there.</p>

<p>I'll definitely find a solution to summarize all of the key points from traveling,
sharing conversations with people and touching the lives of people
(because this will turn into a mess like this blog haha.. which is pretty representative of what NY means to me ðŸ˜‰</p>
