<p>It is good to be an American.  It's also good to travel.
I have this belief that we have two methods of learning through life:</p>
<ol>
  <li>through <b>our own</b> experience and</li>
  <li>through the experience of <b>others</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>London makes a lot of sense.  It also doesn't make a lot of sense.
Crosswalk signal technology, <i>top-notch</i>.  Driving on the lefthand side of the road, <i>whatever</i>.
But.. walking on the righthand side of the sidewalk?  <i>That seems like madness.</i>
I don't actually know which side of the street you're supposed to walk on.
I couldn't find conclusive evidence for where you're supposed to walk.
People kind of just walk all over the place.
The closest thing to guidance were signs on elevators saying to "stand on the right" while riding an escalator ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>I've traveled to a few places already; however, this is the first trip that I'm blogging about, mostly in preparation for the major trip I'd really like to use as a unifying force in my life purpose, namely my Road Trip Across America.
Being a solo trip, my views and experiences while in London were greatly skewed by my introvertedness and other (more important) qualities that I've accrued over my life as an <strong>Indian Trinidadian American</strong>.
I'd like you to really understand what my identity means because it'll be important for understanding the context of my blogs in general.
<i>American</i> is the base word and <i>Indian</i> and <i>Trinidadian</i> are adjectives that affect that base.
<ul>
  <li>I am principally American, which means that who I am, in my habits and cultural way of interaction, has been greatly influenced by my upbringing in this melting pot.
    I genuinely enjoy the American lifestyle I've come to know and, as I travel, I appreciate other countries and cultures, but I have yet to find a place I can call home like <a href="#america">America üá∫üá∏.</a></li>
  <li>My thinking and practical (or impractical) explorative/adventurous nature is inspired from my Trinidadian ideals.
    Trinidad was its own melting pot before America thanks to colonialism.
    There's something very intuitive about the relaxed resourcefulness that was passed down to me from my parents and grandparents surviving and thriving on an island.</li>
  <li>Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (<i>But my heart is Indian</i>).
    In my soul, I truly feel that my desire to connect with people and sense energy within others stems from my Indian heritage.
    I don't believe there's anything further at my core than the truth of my ancestors and the energy I've inherited from them.</li>
</ul></p>

<img class="postimgcenter" src="/static/img/london/20231014_143134_optimized.jpg"/>

<p>One of my close friends encouraged me to take a trip between my old job and my new one and it's thanks to him that I took this one.
If you ask him, he'll be disappointed I didn't go to Singapore haha üòâ
But it's all in good fun.
Apart from taking his advice, this trip was meant to accomplish a few things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Travel to explore the world and learn about other cultures,</li>
  <li>Clear my head and help start a new chapter of my life and</li>
  <li>Connect with people and learn how technology is being used in other parts of the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the beginning of the trip, I was feeling like a failure because, although I had explored a lot, I found it very difficult to connect with people.
Many of the people I encountered were not the friendliest.</p>


<p>I did meet quite a few genuine and nice people with whom I shared some great conversations.
I talked about the disparate accessibility of technology across the generations with a middle-aged first-generation English woman.
She takes care of her mother who still holds the belief that physical records hold some intrinsic value over electronic documents (not different from older generations in America).

I talked about the de-evolution of society and the failure of education systems with a bus driver, who was studying electrical and computer engineering.
He described the decline in societal culture as a result of the increased dependency of younger generations on the internet.
He also commended me for traveling, which he says a lot of people are not doing these days.  I found this interesting because there have been tons of news articles in my feed about people traveling to break out of the pandemic restrictions.  I also know that younger generations typically don't have a lot of money.. so I'm very confused on the actual travel rates of people.

I also talked about the struggles of finding your life path with a foriegn student studying film and media to become a Director.
I think a lot of her story resonated with me because I know a lot of foreign students in America who strive for a better life and, in general, have lots of family pressure to succeed.
However, it's not always clear what to work towards and what to do while not having a clear solution for the future..</p>

<p>In general, there was a rather thick sense of disengagement in the air.</p>

<p>Part of this is attributable to people being absorbed in their own bubbles.
I rode the train A LOT.  Google estimates that I spent 13 hours, traveling 355 miles on the train.
(I don't think that counted the time waiting for trains.)
98% of the people I saw who were by themselves had headphones in their ear.
That isn't unique to London, I know.
That's just the habit of young people (well, at least same as here in America).
I rode the train during morning commuting hours for work and school.
I rode the train during the afternoon/evening get-back-home or go-out-to-decompress-from-the-day times.
I rode on the last trains of the day right up until midnight.
There are so many stories thiat intersect, just like any other major city in the world.
You see people and you can see how occupied they are with... <br/>
studying for school... </br>
preparing for presentations... </br>
parenting... or taking care of their parents... <br/>
relationships... <br/>
being zoned out, stretched thin from whatever responsibilities they may have (responsibilities that I don't pretend to know)... <br/>
traveling... There were sooo many people with suitcases at all times of the day. (It was weird.)
Much of the intricacies of these stories are compounded by the general state of the world.
Information overload that causes people to have issues processing their own life.</p>

<p>Part of this is attributable to people showing favoritism to their own people and societal circles.
I got my fair share of weird looks.
Ironically, many of the people I talked to didn't know I was a tourist, let alone an American haha..
However, maybe some people did know I was a tourist?  Or they didn't like how I looked?
There's a huge community of <a href="#brown">"brown" people üü§</a> in London.
This community was split.
Some were happy and reciprocated my smiles and head nods.
Others had some arrogance to them and felt like they were of higher class.
I also went into some heavily light-skinned and European areas and a good amount of them were not happy I was there.
They were more passive aggressive than anything else.</p>

<img class="postimgright" src="/static/img/london/20231018_135626_optimized.jpg"/>

<p>Although, I'll say the most determining factor that prevented me from connecting was probably my social anxiety and introvertedness.
I reflected on this quite a bit throughout the trip and maybe I was able to manifest some positive energies because I had made more connections with people in the last two days than the first six days combined.</p>

<p>I've come a long way from being soo shy throughout the developing years of my life.
There have been many stages to me opening up and being able to start conversations with people.
The most important turning point was after a serious breakup in 2021.
I decided to be more adventurous and take more risks.
Some have called my decisions reckless, and indeed, there's lots that can scare you about life.
Taking a trip abroad alone definitely sparked some worry in people who care about me.
There were quite a few sketchy areas of London that you could tell weren't super safe.
A week before I arrived, there was a murder of a 14yo school girl not too far from my hotel.
There was a huge memorial and people were viscerally upset about it, with good reason.
</p>


<p>Regardless of, and maybe even because of, this adversity, the experience was invaluable.
Traveling breaks down the traditional line between learning from your experience and learning from the experience of others.
Traditionally, learning in a classroom, reading a book or watching a video, all of these can definitely fall into learning from the experience of others.
Similarly, doing a project, practicing a skill or making decisions on your own are unmistakably learning from your own experience.
Traveling is interesting though.
It forces you to actively make decisions while interacting with others and provides a very unique environment to learn and grow.</p>

<p>There's so much to share about the places I visited and the knowledge I've gained.
I can't possibly cover all of it in this post, so I'll give you the highlights instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Westminster Bridge...Golden Jubilee Bridges...Waterloo Bridge...Blackfriars Bridge...Millenium Bridge...Southwark Bridge...London Bridge...Tower Bridge
    <ul>
      <li>The London Bridge is the most famous bridge by name and the Tower Bridge is the most famous by architecture.</li>
      <li>The Millenium Bridge is the one that showcased in the opening of <u>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</u>.  Unfortunately, it was closed, so I couldn't walk on itüò≠</li>
      <li>I have a special connection to the Waterloo Bridge.  I met a cool friend there.  It's a plain bridge, but I think it's slightly more exciting in design and feel when compared to the London Bridge.</li>
      <li>Blackfriar's Bridge is really cool because the train runs straight through the top and it's a nice area to sit above the river.</li>
      <li>Most of the bridges get lit up at night and it makes the plain designs way more exciting.  It's just so blah during the day.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shaftesbury Avenue
    <ul>
      <li>The main point about this landmark is Hermione's childhood going to the theater with her mom and dad.</li>
      <li>It did not disappoint and I even took a picture with Dean Street too!</li>
      <li>I thought this was super weird.  There's a fair number of casinos (bad casinos.. but still casinos) around Shaftesbury Ave.</li>
      <li>It was raining pretty heavily that day and I got stuck hopping from place to place, trying to not get too wet haha.  Hence me going into the casinos and m&m store and others.. on my way to the Cambridge Theater!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cambridge Theather
    <ul>
      <li>I went to see <u>Matilda</u> here and it was awesome!</li>
      <li>I even met a set of New Yorkers sitting next to me.  They had family in London and came to visit every once in a while.</li>
      <li>Matilda was an Indian girl which I thought was super funny.  The movie was amazing and holds a very special place in my heart.  I was sitting far enough away that I couldn't see the Indian features of the girl, so it didn't effect my interpreation of the movie much.</li>
      <li>The songs were beautiful and Ms. Trunchbull was cast as a MAN!  Hilarious and cool.  "When I grow up", "School Song", "Naughty", "Still Holding My Hand" and soo many more ü•π  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The British Library...Charing Cross Library...Shoe Lane Library
    <ul>
      <li>I got a library card guys!</li>
      <li>The library was packed.  The outside was so bland and boring.  However, the inside was pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Security was pretty tight.  No pens, highlighters, pretty much anything that can be used to destory material.  They had lockers in the basement to store everything that you weren't allowed to carry into the reading rooms.</li>
      <li>I eneded up spending a few hours here because I needed to do my HW for CAP6629 Reinforcment Learning and it was worth it.</li>
      <li>I also went to a few other libraries, just because I was feeling the vibes.</li>
      <li>The topic of consciousness was on my mind and I found a few books that helped to further my NLP exploration.  Hoping to continue working on that soon.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>King's Cross
    <ul>
      <li>Similar to Shaftesbury Avenue, this is only super important for the Harry Potter fan in me haha.</li>
      <li>One of the days I was traveling through, there was live recording going on (for Salvation Army?) with some famous guy and another famous woman.. no idea who they were.  They sang the same song dozens of times and tried to get the crowd excited for cut scenes, but it didn't work too well üòÖ</li>
      <li>The platforms are not so similar to the Harry Potter films.  Either way, I did make it on platform 9 and 10 haha..</li>
      <li>I'm still confused to this day about King's Cross, St. Pancras and the Underground that runs in between the two.  It's a very strange layout.  There are "international" trains that travel there, so it's bound to be a bit chaotic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Big Ben
    <ul>
      <li>I didn't go inside of Big Ben because I was walking to the entrance and then passed it and then felt too lazy to go back and figure out where to go.</li>
      <li>I did get to see the side of it that's along the Thames River where there's usually scenes that break the windows and end up on the outside.  There's definitely a <u>Pirates of the Caribbean</u> scene.  But more accurately, there's a scene in the <u>Sherlock Holmes</u> movie.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Buckingham Palace
    <ul>
      <li>I had hyped up the "Changing of the guards" ceremony and there were a TON of people there.  It was kind of lackluster though..</li>
      <li>It was more about showmanship, formality and musical instruments than it was about anything meaningful.</li>
      <li>The "guards" aren't even the real guards.  The "guards" are guarding 'tradition' and you can see the real guards (i.e. police or SWAT people) doing the real work.</li>
      <li>I don't mean to hate on it.  It's a cultural event.  It was funny though because there were people trying to make it to work, forcing themselves through the crowds of tourists.  Someone even had to defend themselves against police questioning because they were carrying a briefcase haha.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Maze Hill & Greenwich...Prime Meridian...The Queen's House
    <ul>
      <li>One of things I was excited about doing was visiting the Prime Meridian line and seeing the history related to it.  It was kind of disappointing though.</li>
      <li>The "line" was about 60 feet long and was much more anti-climatic than I was hoping.  Still cool to see. I was just envisioning this long line that had much more depth to it.</li>
      <li>Greenwich Park and the Market and general small town was quaint and cute.  It made me think of the Greenwich areas of NY and it had a very similar feeling (from what I remember at least).</li>
      <li>Whenever "Queen" is used in England, I feel like the most popular reference is to Queen Elizabeth (don't ask me I or II because I don't even know the distinction).  But this Queen was originally Queen Anne of Denmark, who I know nothing about still haha..</li>
      <li>In any case, I stole a rose from the Queen's garden (which sounds cooler than it actually is); but I thought it was a fun spontaneous thing to do.  I do flower pressing and love to collect flowers from everywhere I go.  Big or small, they give me sweet memories of places I've been.  I used to collect rocks, but then I had a terrifying experience near Lake Erie and rocks became too risky to collect haha..</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>East Ham
    <ul>
      <li>The main reason I traveled here was to visit Mandirs.  To my surprise, I found a whole big brown community.  I saw the community transition from Hindu to Muslim to more mixed areas.  Right outside the train station had a very Richmond Hill vibe.</li>
      <li>I don't think Mandirs ever disappoint in their consistency, no matter the environment or country.  It's nice to see the culture remain despite what may be happening around it.</li>
      <li>The Mandirs were not the greatest, but cozy.</li>
      <li>I was really feeling for chinese food this day and tried my hardest, visiting no less than 4 chinese food places, with no luck (as you'll read below)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cambridge
    <ul>
      <li>I debated this trip to Cambridge a long time.  For better or worse, it rained pretty hard and I got soaked.  It was an enlightening trip though.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a unified presence of "Cambridge University", but there really were no signs of that.  There's a lot of smaller colleges that make up Cambridge and every one of them has their own school pride and competitions.  It is a typically college town though.</li>
      <li>I definitely picked up some energy from geniuses past, walking where they walked, thinking where they thought and just figuring things out in the places they figured things out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>London Gatwick Airport
    <ul>
      <li>There are 5 main airports in and around London.  Gatwick airport was the only one that had direct flights from FL (even if it was Orlando).</li>
      <li>The gateway national rail was really convenient from the airport to Croydon (where my hotel was) to the center of London.</li>
      <li>It's a decent airport.  Nothing crazy or exciting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Croydon
    <ul>
      <li>I spent a lot of time here.  It was not the best area.  I got warned lots of time by different people to be careful during certain hours and in certain places.</li>
      <li>It had a similar vibe to Brooklyn back in my earlier years.</li>
      <li>It was only a 20 min ride to the center of London.  I think staying closer to the center of London (at least if that's where you're trying to explore) would have been better.  I was working off a budget though and being a spontaneous trip, didn't have too many options.</li>
      <li>I could have stayed in a backpacking shared room ("hotel"?).  I decided against it because I wanted some more freedom and it all worked out</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Borough Market</li>
  <li>Tate Modern</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: this list might see some updates if I remember something that is meaningful enough to mention.</p>
<br/>

<p>The line between technology and reality is becoming very thin.
It's very interesting to see how technology is adopted across the various aspects of life.
Surprisingly enough, London had many of the same conveniences that I see in America (e.g. food delivery, electronic signs, qr codes, contactless payments, ...)
Some of these implementations seemed ahead of America (e.g. electronic (internet-enabled?) bus stop time schedules).
Other implementations seemed behind America (maybe I'm just more used to American things).
As a side story... I didn't exchange any physical money and, of course, no chinese food restaurants accept credit cards üòí
(I feel like there are some chinese restaurants in America that do, although I always have cash, so I've never bought chinese food without cash ü´¢ )</p>

<p>I actually lost my bearings a few times and thought I was in America.
That's how similar a lot of things felt.
The building architecture definitely helped to remind me I was in a foreign place.
However, many of the roads and sidewalks were old and unkept.
There was lots of graffiti.
Wind blew around garbage on the streets.
Despite this, there were groundskeepers around Parliament, sweeping leaves on the sidewalk... with a broom üòë ... a BROOM?!
Well, of course places of "importance" would carry a front to keep up appearances. </p>

<p>If you know me, it doesn't take a lot for me to think something was worth it.
I don't do this out of pity.
I truly believe, even the worst things have some merit and value.
Many times, the value proposition has an effort level that people think is too high and impractical.
I strongly believe that everyone is free to do whatever they'd like.
This is NOT to say that I agree with people going out and killing, stealing, being dishonest, et cetera.
If someone does something (good or bad), they will receive the consequences whether good or bad.
There is good in bad and bad in good.
To tie it back though.. there are invaluable lessons to be learned in negative experiences.
It's our choice to look for those lessons or not.</p>

<p>On my way to London, I watched <u>The Whale</u> with the great Rick O'Connell üòç
That movie is something that I can say was a waste (such a disappointment) and I don't necessarily care about finding a value connection for it.</p>

<p>I'll try to make future blogs shorter and more digestable.
This was just a necessary evil being the first to set the tone and start a new chapter.
I genuinely want my experience to help people and I will do everything in my capacity to make that a reality.
London feels like it set a good stage.
All I've got to do is keep moving forward.</p>

<p id="brown">üü§ There are a lot of interpretations of "brown" and there is a wide array of people who fall into this category.  Brown is a mindset though, not necessarily a skin color.  Although, in general, the groups of people include Indian, certain Southeast Asian countries, Middle Eastern countries and some Caribbean countries.</p>
