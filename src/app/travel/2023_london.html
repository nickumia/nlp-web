<p>It is good to be an American.  It's good to travel as well.  I have this belief that we have two methods of learning through life: (1) through our own experience and (2) through the experience of others.  London makes a lot of sense.  It also doesn't make a lot of sense.  Crosswalk signal technology, top-notch.  Driving on the lefthand side of the road, whatever.  But.. walking on the righthand side of the sidewalk?  That seems like madness.  I don't actually know which side of the street you're supposed to walk on.  It's worse still because I couldn't find conclusive evidence for where you're supposed to walk.  The closest thing is "standing on the right" while riding an escalator **shrug**</p>
