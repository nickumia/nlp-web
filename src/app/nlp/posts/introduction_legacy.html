<h1 class="normal">Hello Traveler!</h1>
<p>I am honored that you are taking time to explore the ideas and theories that are being explained here, if only for your leisure.  You see, the world changes in such a subtle way that many people don't notice the large transformations that occur every day.  And it's not every day that society overhauls the way they do business, or spend time with their family or does some other important third thing.  But it is every day that someone somewhere is doing something differently, making a small change of their own, that's fueling the innovation of tomorrow.</p>
<p>All throughout history, there have been great thinkers, doers and "feelers" <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beyond-good-and-evil/201508/are-you-feeler-doer-or-thinker">(as the term goes)</a>.  These people have seemingly single-handedly spearheaded a revolution at times, so much to the point that it becomes a question.. What would it be like if [insert great person's name here] did not exist?  (I would add names for effect if not for the fear of seeming biased, especially this early on.)</p>
<p>There is no doubt those amazing people (..amazingly good and amazingly terrible..) made large strides in this continual change that we live and breathe.  I would like to argue that each one of them would not have existed (in the way that they did) if not for the hundreds, if not millions, of people before them and around them who had set the stage.  This is not meant to discredit any of their work.  Rather, it shows that their individualities and specialties can only be seen within a group of people.  What does the existence of any of us mean if it weren't for everyone else acting as a reference?</p>
<p>If you read my bio prior to this, you are probably wondering how much of a hypocrite I must be.  I say, "defining someone or something as a relation of/to someone or something else is wrong".  And then, I say, "great people really only mean something because of the ordinary folk (like you and me)."  Contrary to that point, I am merely stating that alongside our individual natures, there is something that connects us all together.  If there wasn't, no one would ever be able to get support from anyone else.  The point is both sides must be acknowledged and appreciated in their own right.</p>
<h1 class="normal">All of that philosophy is cool, but what does it have to do with NLP?!</h1>
<img class="imgr borderedbox inspace-5 img-responsive" style="max-width:40%;" src="/static/img/plan.png" alt="">
<p>I am proposing a radical framework for how to approach NLP in such a way as to allow for the proper development and research of each major element in the world of NLP, namely (1) <a href="../modes/processing.html">Processing</a>, (2) <a href="../modes/language.html">Language</a> and (3) <a href="../pages/natural.html">Natural Core</a>.  These three modes of understanding represent a universe of thought and development that are mutually exlcusive, yet inter-dependent.  If you were to think about the physical manifestation as an example, the Processing, Language and Natural Layers would represent the Crust, Mantles and Core respectively.</p>
<p>Without considering the possibilities of what defines our universe and/or if there are things beyond the limits of the universe, there exists this universe.  Everythin that flows throughout this universe may or may not interact with the Earth.  Things that do interact with the Earth first come into contact with the Earth's Crust/Atmosphere, then the Mantle layers and finally the Earth's Core.  If something ever made it to the Core, it would be life-changing and very critical.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the <u>Processing Language in a Natural way (or "PLaN") Framework</u>, information first needs to flow through the Processing and Language layers before it can make a meaningful impact and be understood by the system.  Very briefly, the <a href="../modes/processing.html">Processing Layer</a> answers the questions of,</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>How will computers input and output language, handling grammar, syntax and other language niceties?</p></li>
  <li><p>What sort of data structures, filtering techniques and algorithms can be used to sort of “normalize” and capture language?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="../modes/language.html">Language layer</a> follows with,</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>How will computers support different languages, possibly make up their own language?</p></li>
  <li><p>How do languages differ from each other; but more importantly how do those differences highlight the similarities concerning what is really important to communicate?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly, the <a href="../pages/natural.html">Natural Core of NLP</a> seeks solutions to,</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>How will computers understand the real-life impact of their words?</p></li>
  <li><p>In essence, what is real-world knowledge to computers?  And how does a machine understand a message?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Current systems (as of November 2018), do not handle all of these aspects of human interaction and the levels of complexity associated with each of them.  Current systems make weak assumptions to answer most of these questions which break down when these systems are put in situations that are not to their liking.  If we hope to achieve some sort of general Artificial Intelligence (AI) or.. just a system that understands why it is doing what it is doing, I believe this framework must be implemented.  There is a lot of concern over creating "smarter" technologies.  I am actually more on the more traditional side of that spectrum and don't really want this technology to exist.  But I don't think it's possible to stop this technology from being created.  So I am trying my best to guide it in the right direction.</p>
<p>Most of these writings will document my journey in discovering a path that might be useful in implementing this idea.  There are no guarantees; however, this will be my life work so... hopefully it will amount to something (:</p>
