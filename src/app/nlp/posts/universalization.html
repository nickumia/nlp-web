<p>As Thomas Edison once said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."  I want you to keep that in mind when you read this.  It's not about any single way of looking at a problem.  It's about all of the ways that people don't look at problems.</p>

<p>This is probably a little late to be saying this, but I don't want to pretend like I have any answers.  The point is to start conversations and discussions to help guide the development of NLP algorithms in a better direction than it has been heading in recent years.</p>

<h2>We need to keep humans in the loop.</h2>

<p>Humans love to draw inspiration from other things in the universe to help solve problems.  From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuLAn3XpYAU">Bio-inspired robotics</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR1woO7Ppyo">Earth-inspired housing</a> and even Inter-disciplinary studies (Computational Finance, Digital Forensics, Computational Linguistics ... okay, enough of the computers! ... Biomedical, <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/features/top-integrative-studies-programs/">Interdisciplinary Studies</a>, that's a legit degree, .. but you get the idea), we love to throw things together and see them eventually work out.</p>

<p>Rarely do we look at ourselves in the present-day and see good things happen.  I would point to the US Government (shutdown), new Brexit issues, the countless environmental, human rights and other problems plaguing the world today.  But, by the time you read this, all of that will be old history and we'll be reminiscing some form of it as being the "good old days".</p>

<p>Politics aside haha, we use our senses to gather data (and information) about the world.  Based on this input, we form some idea or perspective about what we should be doing.  Eventually this ideology leads us to make choices/decisions that impact much more than just us.  The difficulty in getting a computer to model a similar explorative mentality is that we need to figure out what gives us this ability to learn and grow that is (at the time of writing) scientifically unique from other known life forms.</p>

<p>Many NLP efforts either blindly tackle this problem or don't acknowledge how this effects their system.  If technology does not have a strong theoretical foundation, it is very easy to cause unintended issues.  For great examples, look no further than the largest social media networks of 2019.</p>

<h2>Finding the "Uni-verse" in Universal</h2>

<p>Each sense can be interpreted a nearly infinite amount of ways.  <b>The problem with having and using multiple senses lies in finding the correct set of interpretations of each of the senses.</b>  For example, if a person were to scream "NOOOO!!!", there's so many ways that can be translated into writing.  Similarly, if it were to be read from this piece of writing, some people might read it as close to the intended meaning as possible, some might not and some might mis-interpret the intended meaning.  While this may seem frivolous, I do believe that small differences in this way leads to a butterfly effect change of the overall meaning.</p>

<p>I think part of the solution to finding the single instances of each sense that accurately incorporate multiple senses rests in having a good model of the unique attributes that define each sense.  After these sets of attributes seem complete, identifying how the attributes of each sense relate to all or a subset of the attributes of the other sense.</p>

<h2>Writing/Text vs. Speech</h2>

<p>I always find this the weirdest application of this methodology, mainly because I don't like thinking of writing as input from a "visual" sense.  Even though as humans, we use our eyes to receive this input, I think it's much easier to think of writing in terms of "characters/special characters/et cetera."  Considering the field of Forensic Linguistics for a second, the "font" or other handwriting characteristics would need to be captured in some way.  But that seems like a niche-enough case that it won't effect my discussion.  It just supports my original point that every system needs a thorough investigation of use cases.</p>

<p>Getting back to the point haha..</p>

<p>The simplest breakdown of these two "senses" results in a comparison of writing "style" to speech "style."  In this context, 'style' can be defined as the tendancies, habits or unique attributes that define the author of the speech or writing.  Writing "style" can be anything from high-level topic choice, diction or audience-type to low-level word count, words-in-sentence count or sentence-to-question ratio.  Most, if not all of these, are directly comparable to speech.  The more robust this model of "style" is, the better a system will be able to take in information from writing samples and speech samples and understand them in the same or a similar sense.</p>

<h2>Q: "Why can't you be more specific?"</h2>

<p>Hahaha don't you (as a reader) just love when writers ask themselves questions? (:</p>

<p>A: I would be more specific, except for the matter of.. I haven't actually implemented a system with this methodology to date.  Remy, my riddle-conversation generator, dealt only with text.  And my depression-analyzer, Chandni, is the same way as well.  If I were to add a speech element to them, I would definitely delve further into this analysis.</p>

<p>This blog was mainly to discuss why this logic is necessary as well as some of the challenges that need to be solved to add the level of robustness that we want in our computer companions.</p>

<h2>Speech vs. Vision</h2>

<p>While I won't go into extraneous detail, I think it's important to note that <b>most systems simply annotate some visual depiction with text</b> and create a sort of <b>one-to-one relation</b>.  I don't think there's a problem with this, persay.  But this should be the first step.  Normal cameras are 2D and most of the work is being done with this type of data.  Objects are inherently 3D and have many different angles from which they can be viewed.  (Not to mention accessories that change object appearances.)  </p>

<p>The second step would be attaching attributes and understanding things like, Is the object animate?  What is the object used for?  What's it's relation to others (and vice versa)?  Some systems try to incorporate this aspect; but I haven't seen any one do it in an organized manner.</p>

<p>Once a computer is able to get a big-picture understanding of.. a picture haha, it will be able to see object interactions and real-life "actions" of objects that it knows about.  This type of analysis is useful in solidifying abstract knowledge that NLP may gain.</p>

<!-- example of visual system -->
<p><a href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/the-5-computer-vision-techniques-that-will-change-how-you-see-the-world-1ee19334354b">This article</a> lists the biggest fields in computer vision that lend their attributes to NLP applications.  It's funny whenever I look at "other fields" because they are all so relevant to the future of technology and not everyone sees the connections.  Some might argue that computer vision has nothing to do with NLP, but I hope I'm convincing you that the truth is quite contrary to that belief.</p>

<h2>Every sense is within the rest</h2>

<p>The most important thing to think about when attempting to "universalize" a sense is the fact that <b>there is always a connection between two things, no matter how different they may seem.</b>  The specific connection that exists may be as simple as "apples and oranges are both fruits" or as abstract as "walking and driving both use energy."  Some times these connections won't reveal anything by themselves.</p>

<p>Knowing apples and oranges are both fruits is probably less important than the fact that they both have color which acts as both an identifying feature and a measurement of health.  It seems ironic that comparing apples and oranges had once been a great metaphor for saying things are so different.  But the features that are so different represent things that apples and oranges have in common.  <b>Sometimes the most rigid differences are based on the most unifying similarities.</b></p>
