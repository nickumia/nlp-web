<p>I am not a linguist, nor any other language expert.  I do not pretend to know any amount of the various types of languages, how these languages formed or what it even means to define a language.  But I am a human and I do communicate with others with various types of languages.  In the time to come, I am certain that I will learn more and form a more complete idea of what a language truly is.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Language is the life and breath of Communication.</h2>

<p>Everything is connected.  Language helps us to tap into these physical and non-physical connections through which life itself is given essence.  These connections almost force us into action.</p>

<p>Regardless of the true (1) cause, (2) meaning or (3) result of language, I believe it's important to acknoledge that these constucts exist.  And more importantly, the discussion should start with the foundation of this continuous cycle.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why use Language? Just "'cause"?</h2>

<p>Before I even gave this part of the PLAN Frameowrk much thought, I had built it saying that the core of language is based on the <b>beliefs and values</b> of the people who developed the language.  It was a sort of <i>hand-waved</i> notion for <u>whatever people felt like it should mean.</u></p>

<p>While this isn't the best answer, I think that it is the only answer for the question of <i>why each language exists</i> and <i>what it means to use said language</i>.  There is no reason except for the reason that people thought was necessary based on their experience, the experience of their ancestors and the perceived importance of the connections they knew about.</p>

<p>Language was a means of using the various types of connections, both real and abstract.  By extension, this meant each language holds inherently different types of information.  For example, the same question of "What?" can be asked through spoken language or body language.  The choice of either one of those and even the exact <i>dialect</i> would be based on a variety of factors, including environment setting, communication ability, intent ...</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What do you MEEAAAN 'Lanugage Meaning'?!</h2>

<p>At this point, you have chosen to use language for a particular purpose.  You now, essentially, have to decide what you want to "say" or otherwise convey.  It somewhat feeds off of the reason that you chose to communicate.  But goes one step further in narrowing down the specific idea shich may be based on the same belief or value that incited you into action.</p>

<p>This makes it sort of easy because it focuses on the <i>speaker's intent</i> which is directly related to an action defined by a language.   This action may be ambiguous and may have many possible meanings (even within the same language) but there should be identifying features that describe the exact meaning in a given context.  Again, this analysis is from the speakers pov which means it should be easier to define in an output setting, yet harder to understand as an input.</p>

<p>Explaining this portion is the most difficult because it is entirely dependent on the idea being conveyed as a function of the language model prescribed earlier.  The idea is to obtain a "meaning object" as a function of the <i>speaking intent</i> and set of "<i>identifying context features</i>".</p>  

<p>What are these <i>identifying context features</i> you might ask?</p>

<p>I don't really have a good answer for that as of writing.  I could say that it's the features that inherently describe a unique situation.  To help explain this, I'll point to a simple scenario where Roy is helping an old man to cross the street.</p>

<p class="text-muted text-small text-center">NOTE: DICTION CAUSES DANGEROUS LEVELS OF BIAS</p>

<p>Already in this situation, it is easy to see that Roy's intent to help the man cross the street already reveals Roy's caring and considerate nature.  With this in mind, it is easier to see any of Roy's words in a good-hearted light.  From my short description, we don't really know anything about the old man's reception of Roy's help.  He could be thankful for the help.  He could be bitter about needing help.  He could even be indifferent to the boy altogether.</p>

<p>We don't know anything about if the street is busy, how large the intersection is or what type of disability that the man has.  All of these factors only exist because of the environmental setting and contribute to the contextual meaning of language.</p>

<p>Apart from the psychological and environmental state of the situation, there may also be external stimulus factors caused by people and things not directly involved in the current situation.  This list does not attempt to be exhaustive.  It's simply an example to help explain important points.</p>

<p>A complete understanding of this aspect of language would clearly define a global structure or characterization of these <i>contextual features</i> as well as an explaination of how to identify what each participant meant to convey.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Exam results.. Other types of results.. Language Results!?</h2>

<p>I came across an interesting concept in an old linguistic essay called <b>Channel Capacity</b> which is simply a measure of the amount of information that was successfully transmitted.  It's not exactly like a "grade", but it tells about the quality of the conversation.  One might think that this would be language-independent.  But when HOW you would say something in a language changes, HOW that information is received would differ as well.</p>    

<p>Aside from this quality measure, there is also the issue of what happens after language is used.  After you go through school and you take the last test, it's less about your score and more about what happens after.  Language is such that it always sort of requires a response, even if a conversation has ended.  <b>Language is always in motion and the results of this continuous process is usually more language</b>.</p>

<p>The simplest example of this comes in two forms: (1) Taking in an input and taking an action or (2) Making an action and seeing and reflecting on its effects.  These two fundamental ideas form the crux of this mode and help to transition from the Language aspect of NLP to the Natural "universal" aspect of NLP.  All of these ideas will eventually be talked about in further detail, but brief introductions always help with deep understandings later on.</p>
