<p>The idea of consciousness is pretty widely discussed in formal and informal settings which made it a pretty nice intro into this realm of &rarr; What makes us 'us'?  How does this effect the way we communicate?  What point is there to communicate?  To what end are we here for.. ... yeah ... &larr;</p>
<p>As with anything, it's super difficult to be exhaustive, but I want to say all of the building blocks (as far as Nick_2019_10_16 is aware of haha) are one way or another captured in this overview.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Can you think about consciousness?</h2>

<p>Whenever we talk about consciousness, we think we are thinking about our own instances of consciousness at any given point in time.  Borrowing concepts from various philosophies as well as studies of the brain, our consciousness manifests in multiple ways and the form that a person will understand is dependent on their self-awareness and ability to abstract their components.</p>

<p>The short answer is "<i>yes</i>."</p>

<p>We know our consciousness exists; hence, we can think about it.  If the idea or thought of it was unknown, the question would be more elusive.  The question becomes, what effect does being conscious about our consciousness have on life and, more specifically, how we choose to form and communicate ideas.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Cause and Effect Relationship</h2>

<p>The problem with life is that there are sooo many different cultures and representations of life that, when transcendental topics are discussed, everyone gravitates towards their own understanding or instance of the higher concepts; not necessarily the governing ideas in their ultimate form.  This is primarily an issue of abstraction.  For this model, all of those specifics should already be captured by the Language layer.</p>

<p>We don't ask humans to isolate their vision and hand coordination systems when performing a task.  However, by default, these are different systems for a robot or other machine.  Simiarly, the transcendental concepts and life experience are used together, yet they represent independent entities.</p>

<p>Coming back to the point, there will always be a more general form to any idea.  For example, one understanding of the concept of a sky is merely the existence of something above you.  If there is something above a sky, namely outerspace, it is easy to fall into the trap of something existing above that level and the subsequent level and so forth.  The idea of something existing above something else implies a relationship between two objects.  A more general form of this relationship is two things exists with respect to some form of space.  This is rather abstract on its own.  However, it is specific to idea of space.  A more general statement would abtract that concept as well.</p>

<p class="text-muted">Note: This logic could go on endlessly.  There will always be another level at which different parts become relevant.  The ability to derive statements like these are important in communication.  It is what allows communication to be collaborative as opposed to just one-sided.</p>
<!-- <p>^ That logic could go on endlessly.  There will always be another level at which different parts become relevant.  The ability to derive statements like these are important in communication.  It is what allows communication to be collaborative as opposed to just one-sided.</p> -->

<p>The reason humans are able to traverse between ideas in any way is because of the inherent cause-effect relationships that are created as a means of justification.  One thing has certain qualities.  Another thing has certain qualities.  The understanding of how the qualities interact form the basis for a cause-effect relationship.</p>

<p><b>What does cause-effect have to do with consciousness?</b>  Every action is preceded by another action.  Every action is followed by a subsequent action.  These two statements describe everything that we know about the universe.  The only exception is, where did the first action come from?</p>

<p>Our consciousnesses rely on this process or &quot;one-step leads to another&quot; mentality to form ideas.  When we can't think about the first step or miss out a step in between, the whole thought process breaks down.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">That's it!?  THAT'S all there is??</h2>

<p><i>Not quite..</i>  That's <u>HOW</u> things happen, not really <u>WHY</u>...</p>

<p>It's crazy to think that the way in which something happens can be independent of why it happens at all, isn't it?</p>

<p>Michio Kaku describes consciousness in three primary levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Level (1) consciousness understands the relationship of objects with respect to <b>space</b>,</li>
<li>Level (2) consciousness understands the relationship of objects with respect to <b>time</b>,</li> 
<li>Level (3) consciousness understands the relationship of objects with respect to <b>other objects</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a summary of his ideas; but it's important to see its foundation of forming relationships based on an understanding of what makes up the universe as is represented here (time, space and objects).</p>  

<p>From my limited exposure of the subject, Vedanta describes consciousness in terms of self-awareness or self-realization.  With knowledge of oneself, an understanding of the world ensues.  In this way, the manifestation of consciousness is not defined.  Yet, the path to understanding consciousness is lit.  The goal of Vedanta is to search for self-knowledge as well as to search for the divine or permanent aspect of oneself and, by extension, the universe.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of philosophies attempting to explain why consciousness exists and what is means to be conscious.  All of them hold their own set of core truths that allow everything to manifest from.  And that is the primary point....</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The only constant or neutral point between theories is that consciousness allows for variation.</h2>

<p>Whenever we think about what makes us truly human, the only thing that is universal is the fact that we are able to imagine anything.  We are able to use anything to connect or disconnect with others.  We continually expand our thought in new directions, seemingly without bounds.</p>    

<p>When a concept such as this is so elusive to us as humans, how could we possibly think that programming it into a machine can be achieved so easily.  The &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; methods and algorithms that exist today can't come close to representing consciousness in any form of what is described on this page.  I think, for the meantime, we just need to settle with a subset of consciousness.</p>
