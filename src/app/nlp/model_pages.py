• Despite the inability of text to store and retain these things, there are many sources of text and writing where these things are perceived and conveyed to some degree.  When reading a book, an article, a blog, there is a "voice" that is present that influences your understanding of the words used.<br/>

• There is a lot of information ingrained in the sounds that humans hear.  We can distinguish non-living sounds from sounds of the living, harmonious melodies and discords of noise.<br/>
• Assuming we discern a sound as speech, our understanding of the words spoken is influenced by our recognition of various defining characteristics, such as tone, pitch and loudness.  It's important to note that extracting the speaker's meaning is no easy task.<br/>
• Think about how many different people pronounce the same words differently ... Think about all of the different accents that exist ... The point is to understand how all of these factors effect a word's meaning.""",

Much of the world is never explicitly talked about.  When we talk, we often assume things that make up the context of what is being said.  Consider the following conversation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: What is that?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B: I'm not sure.  They've been here for a while now.<br/>
Without visual knowledge of the world, there is no way a computer would know what "that" refers to.  Granted, with a longer conversation, "that" may become known.  However, a human with vision would have a much different understanding of the conversation.

• There are over <a href="https://www.ethnologue.com/about">7,000 languages</a> at the time of writing.  Each of these languages have a host characteristics that define them.<br/>
• Since we are primarily using the English language, most of the analysis will be applied to English; however, we'll try to keep the main concepts as general as possible to allow adaptation for other languages.<br/>
• The end goal is to be able to understand what makes these languages tick, or rather, the mindset of individuals that use each language.

• Dialects present a unique scenario to the realm of NLP.  The argument is that a different language introduces a new perspective on how to communicate ideas.  However, by the same respect, a dialect might just be different enough that it merits its own "language" (i.e. New York English vs. Alabama English).<br/>
• To prevent a million spinoffs from each language, it should be noted that each dialect exists as an extension of a language.  And while there will be differences, these differences should be captured in a language-independent way.<br/>
