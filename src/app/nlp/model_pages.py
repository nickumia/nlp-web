Much of the world is never explicitly talked about.  When we talk, we often assume things that make up the context of what is being said.  Consider the following conversation,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A: What is that?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B: I'm not sure.  They've been here for a while now.<br/>
Without visual knowledge of the world, there is no way a computer would know what "that" refers to.  Granted, with a longer conversation, "that" may become known.  However, a human with vision would have a much different understanding of the conversation.

• There are over <a href="https://www.ethnologue.com/about">7,000 languages</a> at the time of writing.  Each of these languages have a host characteristics that define them.<br/>
• Since we are primarily using the English language, most of the analysis will be applied to English; however, we'll try to keep the main concepts as general as possible to allow adaptation for other languages.<br/>
• The end goal is to be able to understand what makes these languages tick, or rather, the mindset of individuals that use each language.

• Dialects present a unique scenario to the realm of NLP.  The argument is that a different language introduces a new perspective on how to communicate ideas.  However, by the same respect, a dialect might just be different enough that it merits its own "language" (i.e. New York English vs. Alabama English).<br/>
• To prevent a million spinoffs from each language, it should be noted that each dialect exists as an extension of a language.  And while there will be differences, these differences should be captured in a language-independent way.<br/>

• Energy is ubiquitous around us.  It is present in things we can sense and in things we do not yet know how to sense.  One of the first clear distinctions to make is that physical energy is different from life energy.  <b>Physical energy</b> causes much of the world around us to move, change and flow.  <b>Life energy</b> is what we have inside of us that allows us to think, create and make decisions.  They may be one and the same.  However, we do not currently understand them as such.<br/>
• Energy is very unique because it can always be converted into a form that is relevant to its application.  Matching the form with the application causes wondrous things to happen.  Furthermore, by understanding the flow of energy, the power of its reality can be unlocked..
