We know so little about our universe, yet we constantly create and indulge in new universes which may or may not be possible.  Our ability to weave together anything and everything makes our existence very dynamic.  We have a word for \\\"\u003ci\u003eeverything\u003c/i\u003e\\\" and this ability of ours to imagine is only limited by us (when not considering diseases that prohibit mental capacity).  Normally, we don\u0027t think of humans as God (and imho we aren\u0027t exactly).  But to think we have all of this power.  You should just think about why we could have possibly been given it.  For what reason do we need it.\"}"
