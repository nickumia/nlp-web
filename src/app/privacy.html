<p>Hi there!  You're probably wondering what this is.
This is your friendly NLP guy, nickumia.
Well.. there's no way for you to verify that.
AND there's no protections in place to guarantee the author of the text you are reading.
Well.. not yet at least.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

<p>I wanted to enable Google Analytics on my website in order to gauge how many users are interested in what I have to say.
Typically, businesses are data- and money- hungry, so they collect data for reasons that the general public should very much be concerned about.
I currently don't have any products.
AND I don't use ADs, because just like rock, paper, scissors, it's an EVIL game ðŸ˜±
I am not collecting data with Google Analytics for monetary purposes and I have turned off all Ad personalization features that I know about.
So, your data is not, to my knowledge, being used for anything.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy this requirement from Google, I am posting this message and linking to Google's privacy policy and other data collection documentation.
If you have any concerns, please feel free to reach out to me with any information from <a href="/kumia">my personal page</a>.</p>
