# Getting Information about Current Financial Products

As a licensed financial professional, you will generally act as an agent to a broker-dealer.
A broker-dealer deals in two parts:
  1. **A Broker** manages transactions for different
entities, 
  2. **A Dealer** buys or sells products/services with its own capital that it manages
directly.

Many of these insurance entities (WFG, Primerica, various 3rd-party organizations)
act as a broker and sell products on behalf of the big investment/insurance company names (
Fidelity, Transmerica, Nationwide, Pacific Life, Prudential, John Hancock, ...).  Each broker
will have a catalog of what products it has available.

If you are also a non-captive agent, you will be able to create accounts with each broker-dealer
that your broker does business with in order to gain access to tools, product information and more.

## World Financial Group (WFG)

As I am a licensed agent with WFG, this section will be heavily biased toward their processes and
procedures.  When you sign into the www.mywfg.com portal, there is an interface that gives an
overview of the "Product Guide".  It shows the Product Name and Type, the Provider Name and Tier
and the status of whether the product is active/inactive.

As much as I'd like to say that this utility is all that you need, it is not very comprehensive.
It should list all of the details, costs and commissions for the products; but the majority of
the products I looked at had missing information.

This at least gives you an overview of what products you have available.  If you are looking for
term life insurance, just search for "term".  If you're looking for indexed universal life, search
for "iul".  Or if it's annuities, then search for "annuity".

## Provider Specific Websites

Once you have choosen a product that you'd like to learn more about, note down the provider name
and go to their website in order to gain more information.  

> [!NOTE]
> A product is unique to state AND provider, meaning that both must be considered when
> assessing product information.  See Appendix A for more information.

### Customer-Ready General Information

When you are a registered agent, you obtain a National Insurance Producer Registry number.  This
will be different from your SSN, but, in most cases, it is tied to your SSN.  On the provider
website, when you create an account, you'll fill out your SSN and basic information to gain access
to their portal.  The only way you gain access to this information as a financial professional
is because your license is registered in the Natioanl Database.

A list of provider login websites:
- https://www.transamerica.com/login/financial-professional
- https://financial.nationwide.com/login
- https://loginportal.pacificlife.com/centrallogin/Account/SSO
- https://www.johnhancock.com/sign-in.html#id-For-financial-professionals

Each provider will have their own structure to locate product information, but it'll be something
of the form "Sales & Marketing Materials/Resources".

### Customer-Unique Illustrations

The best method to learn about the products is to use the illustration software to run scenarios
for different states, policy amounts, policy types, ages, health types, et cetera...

Downloadable Illustrator Softwares:
- [Transamerica](https://www.mywfg.com/transamerica-offline-illustrator-download)
- [Pacific Life](https://lifelineportal.pacificlife.com/wps/myportal/lifeline/Resource-Center/Software---Tools/Illustrations--%22Navigator%22-)
- [Nationwide Life](https://financial.nationwide.com/iApp/ssc/tool/illustrations/lifemgr.action)

All of the illustrators generate a report that contains an outline of the fees and costs associated
with the needs of the specific scenario which provide the most comprehensive information to clients
with questions.

### Other tools

There are lots of analyzers, tools, estimators, calculators, ... that are available online; some of
which are provider-specific to their products.  I'll do a deeper dive on these other tools and
assess the ones I think are useful in a separate document.

## What Matierals to Use and When

# Appendix A

Licensing and appointments generally have state-specific requirements that are hard to generalize.
I've heard about giant tables that cross-reference requirements between each state and show all
of the details.  Apart from me being skeptical about such a chart, as I don't have access to that,
I'll give the general process as it relates to this:

1. Pass Pre-licensing Education (if required for your home state)
2. Pass Licensing Exam
3. Fill out Licensing Forms (fingerprints, background check, state fees)
4. Wait for State Department approval of license
5. Complete Continuing Education Requirements for State
6. Become appointed to "Primary" (sole if captive) Insurance Broker
7. Complete Continuing Education Requirements for Insurance Broker
8. Wait for Broker approval of your appointment

Steps 1-5 are for state licensing.
Steps 6-8 are for carrier appointment.

I'm pretty sure those must be completed before creating an account on specific provider portals.
