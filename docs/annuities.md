# Overview

There are many companies that offer annuity products (e.g. Athene, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Allianz, Corebridge Financial, F&G, Nationwide, North American Sammons Financial Group).  Each carrier will have their own product training required to sell their products.  WFG, in accordance with AMS Financial Solutions, acts as broker that lets you contract with all of them.  AMS works with SureLC to ensure all of your qualifications are met in order to contract with carriers and sell annuities, this includes:
- Basic info (name, address, legal info)
- Financial License info (life, securities, etc)
- Continuing Education/Training info (AML, Best Interest, Annuity, LTC, etc)
- E&O Insurance

The general steps are:
1. Submit all information above to SureLC
2. Complete any missing training
   - This is mostly completed through professional financial services, such as Kaplan Financial (there are others)
4. Complete carrier specific product training
   - This is mostly completed through RegEd
5. Call AMS to ensure your information is put into the Annuities National DB to be able to register with carriers
6. Sign up/Register for carrier websites
  - This gives you access to product material, illustration software, other sales resources.
6. Use RightBridge to submit client applications
