          This page will be home to the updates relating to my road trip across America, coined as Spiritual
          Tech.  It's important to understand the meaning behind the naming.  I'm defining <i>spiritual</i> as
          anything that is not physical and my goal is to use technology to connect these spiritual elements to
          create a better tomorrow.  I can't do it alone and I wouldn't want to if I could.  As much freedom as
          there is in doing stuff by yourself, it's way more fun to do it with great company.

          From my career across academia, government and industry, I have found my niche as a Technology
          Integrator. As the world is constantly evolving and technology lifecycles are getting shorter and
          shorter, my goal is help people create a personal understanding of technology to enable a better
          quality of life, on an individual level as well as at a community or organization level.

          To better understand the current state of how the American people understand and interact with
          technology, I am taking a road trip across America, visiting at least the 48 contiguous states.
          I am interested in learning about how social, economic, cultural and generational conditions
          intersect with technology adoption and use. I believe that technology augments our inherent
          ability and adds value to our existing value.
				</Typography>
				<Typography variant="subtitle2">
          I'd like to meet people to discuss where/when/how/why technology is either helping or failing
          them and offer insight into different ways of understanding and thinking about technology. My
          ultimate goal is spreading Technology Literacy concepts that will help even the playing field
          into the technologically advancing future.  Technology should meet people where they are and
          as such, I will be integrating into communities to learn and grow with them.
