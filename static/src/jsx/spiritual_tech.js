          This page will be home to the updates relating to my road trip across America, coined as SpiritualTech.
          It's important to understand the meaning behind the naming.  I'm defining <i>spiritual</i> as the
          underlying energy that connects us all and my goal is to use technology to connect us together more
          effectively to create a better tomorrow.  There are other terms like, 'Energy-based Tech' or 'Value-based
          Tech' but they don't carry a nice ring to it.  As next gen technology continues to advance in the fields
          of brain interfaces, AI and Quantum, we're going to continue to learn more about what makes us up, what
          makes the universe up and how everything is pieced together.  I can't do this journey alone and I
          wouldn't want to if I could.  As much freedom as there is in doing stuff by yourself, it's way more fun
          to do it with great company.  So join me, reach out, open the conversation in your circles.  Let's talk
          and connect!

          From my career across academia, government and industry, I have found my niche as a Technology
          Integrator. As the world is constantly evolving and technology lifecycles are getting shorter and
          shorter, my goal is help people create a personal understanding of technology to enable a better
          quality of life, on an individual level as well as at a community or organization level.

          To better understand the current state of how the American people understand and interact with
          technology, I am taking a road trip across America, visiting at least the 48 contiguous states.
          I am interested in learning about how social, economic, cultural and generational conditions
          intersect with technology adoption and use. I believe that technology augments our inherent
          ability and adds value to our existing value.

          I'd like to meet people to discuss where/when/how/why technology is either helping or failing
          them and offer insight into different ways of understanding and thinking about technology. My
          ultimate goal is spreading Technology Literacy concepts that will help even the playing field
          into the technologically advancing future.  Technology should meet people where they are and
          as such, I will be integrating into communities to learn and grow with them.

          If SpiritualTech is all about consciousness, why not call it ConsciousTech?
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          While consciousness is a core concept of SpiritualTech,
          the main idea is about finding our own value and connecting
          with others to share that value, using technology as a
          medium.<br/><br/>

          It's not about creating technology that is conscious.
          Being conscious of technology is only important while we
          use technology to create better lives.<br/><br/>

          The truth behind SpiritualTech is in the connection with
          ourselves and with others.  A connection to real life,
          not just focusing on technology.
