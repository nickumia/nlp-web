          This page will be home to the updates relating to my road trip across America, coined as Spiritual
          Tech.  It's important to understand the meaning behind the naming.  I'm defining <i>spiritual</i> as
          anything that is not physical and my goal is to use technology to connect these spiritual elements to
          create a better tomorrow.  I can't do it alone and I wouldn't want to if I could.  As much freedom as
          there is in doing stuff by yourself, it's way more fun to do it with great company.

          For now, check out the trailers for my trip to get a feel for what it'll be like.  If you like it,
          please reach out and let's make some great stuff happen together!
